# bcmaps

An [R](http://r-project.org) package of map layers for British Columbia

### Features

Various layers of B.C., such as administrative boundaries, natural resource 
management boundaries, etc. All layers are available as [sp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) objects, and are in 
[BC Albers](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-bc-albers/) projection, which is the [B.C. government standard](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hts/risc/pubs/other/mappro/index.htm).

### Installation

The package is not available on CRAN, but can be installed using
the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")

```

### Usage

At the moment, there are four layers available:

- `bc_bound`: The provincial boundary of British Columbia (at 1:7.5M scale)

- `regional_districts_analysis`: Detailed Regional District boundaries (Which are based on Canadian cencus boundaries). Suitable for situations where you need detailed boundaries (faithful to the original representation).

- `regional_districts_disp`: Simplified Regional District boundaries. Much smaller file size than the analysis layer, suitable for situations where you don't need detailed boundaries, often useful when making maps for display.

- `ecoprovinces`: Boundaries of B.C.'s ten ecoprovinces (http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/ecoprovinces-ecoregion-ecosystem-classification-of-british-columbia)

- `ecoregions`: Boundaries of B.C.'s ten ecoregions (http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/ecoregions-ecoregion-ecosystem-classification-of-british-columbia)

- `airzones`: Boundaries of B.C.'s seven [Air Zones](http://www.bcairquality.ca/plans/national-air-quality-management-system.html), used for monitoring, reporting and taking action on air quality in British columbia (http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/british-columbia-air-zones)

To load any of them, simply type `data(layer_name)`, where `layer_name` is the 
name of the layer of interest. Then you can use the data as you would any `sp`
object. A couple of simple examples:

```{r plot-maps, fig.height=5}
library(bcmaps)

# Load and plot the boundaries of B.C.
data(bc_bound)
plot(bc_bound)

## Next load the Regional Districts data, then extract and plot the Kootenays
data(regional_districts_disp)
kootenays <- regional_districts_disp[grep("Kootenay", 
                                          regional_districts_disp$region_name), ]
plot(kootenays)
text(coordinates(kootenays), 
     labels = kootenays$region_name, cex = 0.6)
```


### Project Status

Under active development, we will add different layers iteratively.
